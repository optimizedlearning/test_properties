# Current results
- Consecutive: Compute properties of consecutive iterates (consecResnet on wandb).
- final_iterate_cifar:  Compute properties of iterate with respecte to the final training iterate. (finaliterateCifar on wandb).
- last_iterate_epoch: Compute properties of iterate with respecte to the final iterate of each epoch (comparedToEpochIterate on wandb)
# To-do:
- Get large batch iterates.
- Run experiment with fix random seed?.
- Get some bad results.
