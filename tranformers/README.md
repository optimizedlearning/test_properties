# Setup:
1. The first option is to clone the original hugging face repo using git clone:
```python3
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
```
Then run: 
```python3
pip install -e .
```
(this allows us to install all the packages in editable mode).
Finally, copy over the scripts in this repo to run experiments on specific tasks.

2. Copy over the directory: /projectnb/aclab/tranhp/transformers/, install packages with `pip install -e .`,  and run the appropriate scripts.
