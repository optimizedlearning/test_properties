Current experiments are run using https://github.com/mosaicml/examples/tree/main/examples/benchmarks/bert. 
# To-do: Basically the same things we did in ImageClassification
- Run through the training to get properties and consecutive iterates and all the check points.
- Re-run and compute the properties with respect to the final iterate and last-epoch iterate.
